## Description

this was a fun one to create. Its fun to use new technologies to improve upon our first attempt at the portfolio. React felt super fluid to use and made creating the app pretty enjoyable. the hardest part of this app was getting gh-pages running. I had a first attempt but didnt get pages running and it broke my app.
